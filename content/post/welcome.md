## Purpose

The chief purpose of this blog is a research log.
i like the idea of being able to re-derive a complex topic from first principles,
and i want this blog to be structured like this.
This blog's contents can (roughly) be divided into two parts.
firstly, as a high level distillation of my research in various subfields of mathematics.
secondly, as a software architecture, engineering, and administrative journal.
I am strong believer in the necessity to make mathematics constructive; the best way
to explore and understand high level mathematical concepts is to implement them with code.
