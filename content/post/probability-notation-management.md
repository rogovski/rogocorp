## Preface

there is alot of notation out there.

## Random Variables

P(X)
- this is a distribution

P(X = x*)
- this is a real number ranging from 0-1

P(X | Y = y*)
- this is a distribution

P(X = x* | Y = y*)
- this is a real number ranging from 0-1

f(y*) = P(X = x* | Y = y*)
- this is a function with domain Y and codomain [0,1]
- called the likelihood function
