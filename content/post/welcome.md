## Purpose

This blog's contents can (roughly) be divided into two parts.
Firstly, as research notes in various subfields of mathematics.
Secondly, as a software architecture, engineering, and administrative journal.

### Research Journal

The chief purpose of this blog is a research log.
I like the idea of being able to re-derive a complex topic from first principles, and I hope to write and structure posts to reflect that sentiment.
I am strong believer in the necessity to make mathematics constructive; the best way
to explore and understand high level mathematical concepts is to implement them with code.

### Development Handbook

I also know from experience that there is significant overhead (time loss, frustration) associated with 
context switching between the 'lofty' topics - such as understanding and efficiently implementing statistical
algorithms - and the 'earthly' ones - digging through the ansible documentation to tweak your aws deployment playbook.
Therefore, this blog will also serve as a handbook for mundane engineering considerations.

## Topics

The following is a non-exhaustive list of topics that are/will be covered in this blog:

* Computer Science
* Functional Programming
* Foundations of Math
* Abstract Algebra
* Category Theory
* Finance
* Basic Math
* Higher Basic Math (Calculus and Linear Algebra)
* Statistical Learning
* Dev Ops

## Inspiration

I like the following blogs/resources:

* [math n programming](https://jeremykun.com/)
* [existential type](https://existentialtype.wordpress.com/)
* [better explained](https://betterexplained.com/)
* [mathematical monk](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcAtD_VYwcYwVbTdvArsm7w)
